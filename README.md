Summary:
This project creates four classes for the purpose of creating a simulated card
game.  It also includes unit and integration tests for those four classes.
The card class simulates the creation of a card with a face value and suit.
The guess class creates a combination of a card object with a user's card
guess stored as a string. The Deck class stores an array of cards and provides
a method for sorting the cards. The Round class provides the ability to start
rounds, record guesses, and adjust which simulated card is at the top of the
deck.

Use:
Run files from the sorting_cards directory using any of the Ruby files
in the lib directory.
